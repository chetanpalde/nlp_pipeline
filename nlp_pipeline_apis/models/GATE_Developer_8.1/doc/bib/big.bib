        ABSTRACT = "         This article is W.'s response to Barwise and                            Perry's Situation         Semantics. W. suggests that B \& P, while  remaining          within the         realist tradition, have moved the  'semantic fulcrum'   by        accepting         a different view of what  constitute real things,   the        primitives         into which reality is  carved up, from the   Montagovians. B  \&       P         accept individuals,  relations and locations   as primitive,  and               do not require  possible worlds to figure in   their ontology.  While                acknowledging that their formal treatment   allows for more  elegant                handling of things like discourse   situations, etc. he  feels they            have     not addressed the real   problem, which for him  involves rejecting            the     realist assumption   that there is a reality  independent of            language use     for  language  to map onto. For W.  meaning is  determined           by use of      language  within a community, and  language  should be           viewed as  activity      rather than description. He   introduces 2 analaogies:            (1) economics      could suppose a value   function which maps each            object onto a real  value     and market   activity could then be viewed            as perturbations  to the  real     value  - W. suggests that a better            perspective is to  view value  as      determined by activities of buying            and selling (2)  relation of   roads  to    terrain - terrain conditions            road placement  but does  not   determine it   -  road placement is          more   fundamentally   determined by   prior human  needs   and wants         -  who needs   to go   where. W. suggests   situation  semantics may           be  useful for     describing increasingly more    sophisticated artificial            languages     (e.g. computer languages)  where   the assumptions it           makes  about a     neatly divided world  existing   independently of         the   language   hold    true."
